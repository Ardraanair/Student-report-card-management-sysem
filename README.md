# 🎓 Student Report Card System

This is my **Class XII CBSE Computer Science Investigatory Project**, titled **"Student Report Card"**, built using **Python** and **MySQL**. It was submitted as part of the AISSCE March 2023 board exam requirement at **Sree Narayana Public School, Gurudevapuram**.

The project demonstrates how student marks can be stored, processed, and displayed in a clean, structured report format using basic programming and database concepts.
